                We only have one project in mind, and it's mostly a concept.
                This area has a bunch of images of our game and a Trello and video explaining our game.

                    Project Shatterspeed is a fast-paced action FPS concept developed by Tomfoolery Workshop during our college's Metaverse GameJam for game concepts, which we SOMEHOW won.

                    Shatterspeed throws players into breakneck combat across multiple levels filled with relentless enemies, challenging bosses, and LORE. Designed for maximum speed, style, and chaos, it’s a concept that pushes both reflexes and aggression to the limit. Speed isn't just part of the gameplay...

                <p>
                    In the near future, humanity finds ancient technology from their ancestors that turns sand into glass humanoids.

                    They used this technology to build their large structures, most notably the Pyramids of Giza.

                    A new government was built to utilise this technology, not as a means of progressing humanity, but for war.

                    They created an AI and trained it through a simulation in order for it to learn and get used to the glass body before implementing it to the glass figure.

                    You play as the AI as it slowly learns what it is capable of. However, as it goes through the levels, it enters a forbidden area of the simulation.

                    The player now has two choices, go rogue or continue following what it was programmed to do.

                    If the player chooses to continue to follow the simulation, the difficulty will be set easier.

                    If the player decides to go rogue, it activates the second AI, meant to be a failsafe, and the difficulty becomes extremely hard.

                    As they progress, the end fight will be against the boss, and depending on the difficulty, it will differ.

                    If rogue, the player will fight against the secondary AI.

                    If following the program, the player will fight the programmed boss.

                    In the end, both paths will send the AI to their new glass body in the real world.
